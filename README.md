# Conway's Game of Life
Conways game of life is a zero-player game invented by the mathematician John Horton Conway. 

Rules:
1. Every live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies.
2. Every live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbours dies.
3. Every dead cell with 3 live neighbours becomes alive
4. Every live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on to the next generation.




This is a simple example of a glider wich moves in one direction and a slight demonstration of how the program works:
